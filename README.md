# Project Overview
This project focused on developing data-driven strategies to improve customer targeting for Tuangoâ€™s mobile advertising campaigns. Using a real-world dataset of over 400,000 mobile customers, we analyzed purchase behavior, demographics, and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) variables to predict response likelihood and order size for promotional deals. Logistic and linear regression models were applied to identify high-value customers, assess profitability, and determine breakeven response rates. By comparing blanket targeting against model-driven selective targeting, the project quantified potential profit gains and improved return on marketing expenditures. The analysis demonstrated how predictive modeling can optimize mobile ad campaigns by balancing customer engagement, cost efficiency, and long-term retention.

# Objectives
- Evaluate Effectiveness: Measure how customized push notifications influence customer purchases.
- Improve Targeting: Identify the most important factors driving customer response to promotions.
- Compare Approaches: Assess the profitability of targeted versus broad marketing strategies.

# Project Components
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed datasets for analysis.
- Exploratory Analysis: Visualized customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

# Modeling:
- Logistic regression to predict purchase likelihood.
- Linear regression to analyze order size and buying patterns.
- Profitability Analysis: Estimated financial impact of targeted vs. non-targeted campaigns.

# Data Overview
Datasets:
- Pre-Test: Customers who received push notifications.
- Post-Test: Follow-up on their purchasing behavior.
- Rollout: Control group without notifications.

# Key Features:
