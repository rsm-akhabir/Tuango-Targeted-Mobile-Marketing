This project focused on developing data-driven strategies to improve customer targeting for Tuangoâ€™s mobile advertising campaigns. Using a real-world dataset of over 400,000 mobile customers, we analyzed purchase behavior, demographics, and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) variables to predict response likelihood and order size for promotional deals. Logistic and linear regression models were applied to identify high-value customers, assess profitability, and determine breakeven response rates. By comparing blanket targeting against model-driven selective targeting, the project quantified potential profit gains and improved return on marketing expenditures. The analysis demonstrated how predictive modeling can optimize mobile ad campaigns by balancing customer engagement, cost efficiency, and long-term retention
